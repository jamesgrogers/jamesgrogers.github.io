I am a [Kavli Institute](https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk) Senior Research Fellow at the [Institute of Astronomy](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk), University of Cambridge. Previously, I held a [NASA Postdoctoral Program](https://npp.orau.org/about/index.html) fellowship at UCLA, mentored by Hilke Schlichting. I attained my PhD from Imperial College London in 2022, supervised by James Owen.


My research is based on exoplanet formation and evolution, specifically the various processes that occur to highly irradiated planets. I use numerical simulations and statistical modelling to rewind the clock on planet evolution. For more details, please see a list of my [publications](https://jamesgrogers.github.io/publications/) or my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ejty4xxx8j5xbg/Curriculum_Vitae_JGR.pdf?dl=0)


If you interested in any of my work, please feel free to get in touch.
