I am a British astrophysicist working as an [AEThER](https://planets.carnegiescience.edu) postdoctoral fellow at UCLA in the [Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences](https://epss.ucla.edu) department.

My research is based on exoplanet formation and evolution, specifically the various processes that occur to highly irradiated planet atmospheres. I use statistical modelling as well as numerical simulations to rewind the clock on atmospheric evolution to 
unveil the planet population at birth.

If you interested in any of my work, please feel free to get in touch.
