I am a British astrophysicist working as an [AEThER](https://planets.carnegiescience.edu) postdoctoral fellow at UCLA.
My research focusses on exoplanet formation and evolution, specifically the various processes that occur to planet's atmospheres.

If you interested in any of my work, please feel free to get in touch.
