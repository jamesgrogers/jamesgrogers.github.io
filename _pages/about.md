I am an astrophysicist working as a [Kavli Institute](https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk) Senior Fellow in the [Insitute of Astronomy](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk). Previously, I held a [NASA Postdoctoral Program](https://npp.orau.org/about/index.html) fellowship at UCLA. I attained my PhD from Imperial College London in 2022.

My research is based on exoplanet formation and evolution, specifically the various processes that occur to highly irradiated planets. I use numerical simulations and statistical modelling to rewind the clock on planet evolution. For more details, please see a list of my [publications](https://jamesgrogers.github.io/publications/) or my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ejty4xxx8j5xbg/Curriculum_Vitae_JGR.pdf?dl=0)
