I am a British astrophysicist working as a [NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP)](https://npp.orau.org/about/index.html) research fellow at UCLA in the [Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences](https://epss.ucla.edu) department. In October 2024, I will be joining the University of Cambridge as a Kavli Senior Fellow.

My research is based on exoplanet formation and evolution, specifically the various processes that occur to highly irradiated planets. I use numerical simulations and statistical modelling to rewind the clock on planet evolution. For more details, please see a list of my [publications](https://jamesgrogers.github.io/publications/) or my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ejty4xxx8j5xbg/Curriculum_Vitae_JGR.pdf?dl=0)

If you interested in any of my work, please feel free to get in touch.
